# Introduction
My project is a blog about Vision 2030, the projects planned in Saudi Arabia Under the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, Vision 2030 was launched, a roadmap drawn up by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, to harness the strengths God bestowed upon us – our strategic position, investment power and place at the center of Arab and Islamic worlds. The full attention of the Kingdom, and our Leadership, is on harnessing our potential to achieve our ambitions.
"So I decided to highlight this great project"

# Purpose of the project
The aim of my blog is to benefit the reader by focusing on projects that are rich in the Kingdom’s culture and vision because Saudi Arabia has long occupied an important role in the heart of the Islamic and Arab worlds. A land with a rich and proud history
