              <p class="card-text">Built on the Red Sea in northwest Saudi Arabia, NEOM is a living laboratory – a place
                where entrepreneurship and innovation will chart the course for this New Future.



                It will be a destination; a home for people who dream big and want to be part of building a new model
                for sustainable and prosperous living.



                NEOM is not just a place - it’s a mindset. It’s being designed, constructed and independently
                administered in a way that is free from outdated economic and environmental infrastructure that
                constrains other countries across the world.



                The NEOM project aims to achieve exceptional livability, thriving businesses and reinventing
                conservation, in line with Saudi Vision 2030.</p>

                  "THERE IS A FUTURE,
                  IT'S CALLED THE LINE"
                </h1>
                <p>
                  <h3>WHAT IS THE LINE?</h3>
                  THE LINE is a never-before-seen approach to urbanization – a 170km-long linear urban development of
                  multiple, hyper-connected communities, with walkable neighborhoods integrated with public parks and
                  the natural landscape. It is a model of urban design and livability in harmony with nature for the
                  21st century and beyond.

                  THE LINE will reshape the traditional concept of urban life, enabling NEOM to become an economic
                  engine for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the region, and the world.

                  THE LINE will create 380,000 new jobs, spur economic diversification and contribute SAR 180bn to
                  domestic GDP by 2030.

                  Powered by 100% renewable energy, the principles of environmental responsibility will be enshrined in
                  business regulations to promote sustainable and regenerative development practices.
                  All essential daily needs will be within a five-minute walk.
                  Communities will be built around people, not cars, easily accessible and designed for convenience and
                  walkability, creating vistas of beauty and tranquility.
                  THE LINE is supported by a physical and digital infrastructure layer seamlessly integrated beneath the
                  surface and containing essential utilities and transportation services.
                  The infrastructure spine will include ultra-high-speed mass transit access to the communities along
                  THE LINE.
                  Communities will live in harmony with nature, where open space, parks, gardens, the natural
                  environment and sustainable food production are mixed seamlessly.
                  All businesses and communities on THE LINE are hyper-connected through a digital framework
                  incorporating Artificial Intelligence and robotics that continuously learn and grow – over 90% of the
                  data in NEOM will be analyzed to provide a predictive system with ever-improving services to residents
                  and businesses.
                  The communities will be self-sufficient and reflect the personality of their residents, the region and
                  the industries within them.

              <h4>Drawn from its rich Saudi heritage, Qiddiya forges a new future for Riyadh</h4>

              Located on the doorstep of Riyadh, the story of Qiddiya goes back centuries.

              Long ago, the village of Qiddiya lay along one of the trade and pilgrimage routes that intersected the
              Arabian Peninsula.

              Qiddiya’s modern era began on April 25, 2016, when the Saudi government announced Vision 2030, a
              blueprint for long-term prosperity.

              As part of Vision 2030, His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister
              and Chairman of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs and of the Qiddiya Board of Directors,
              announced the Qiddiya project on April 7, 2017.

              Qiddiya will support several goals of Vision 2030 which include driving economic diversification, job
              creation, fostering a start-up culture, driving youth and female empowerment and doubling household
              spending on domestic leisure and entertainment,FOR MORE INFO <a href="https://qiddiya.com/">click Here</a>

              <p class="card-text">Located just 20 minutes northwest of Riyadh’s city center, Diriyah will be
                transformed into one of the world’s foremost lifestyle destinations for culture and heritage,
                hospitality, retail, and education, and will become one of the world’s great gathering places.



                At the heart of the development is the At-Turaif UNESCO World Heritage Site, an iconic mud-brick city,
                and the home of the First House of the Al Saud family and capital of the First Saudi State, preserved
                and restored for future generations.



                Combining traditional Najdi architectural typology and new urbanism, Diriyah will be a place that
                connects emotionally with visitors and residents, promotes, and celebrates the destination’s rich
                heritage and reveals the origins of modern Saudi Arabia and the spiritual values in which it is rooted.



                Under the mandate of Diriyah Gate Development Authority, the project contributes to Vision 2030, by its
                target of 27 million local and international visitors by 2030. This supports the national tourism
                strategy which aims to host 100 million worldwide tourists in the Kingdom by 2030.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The Saudi Genome Program (SGP) will create a database to document the first genetic
                map of the Saudi society, develop personalized medicine practice, reduce the cost of healthcare, and
                improve quality of life.



                The program supports healthcare provision through better diagnosis, therapy, and prevention. Major
                outcomes will include the implementation of premarital and newborn screening, cancer screening and
                targeted therapy, and better management of other multifactorial genetic diseases such as diabetes and
                loss of vision/hearing.</p>

              <h5>The Saudi Genome program</h5>
              is a pioneering national transformation initiative of Saudi Vision 2030. The
              program objectives are to reduce the incidence of genetic diseases in the kingdom, establish a genetic
              database, and document the first Saudi genetic map by sequencing the genome of Saudi population.
              Consequently, the program will establish the foundation for personalized medicine and genomic sciences in
              the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is the largest genetic based disease discovery effort in the Middle East
              and it will enable the Kingdom to have affirm its global lead in the field of genetic research for
              diseases and personalized medicine.

              The program’s deliverables will have direct positive impact on the Saudi public health, as genetic
              information about the Saudi population can be employed in detecting, diagnosing, and preventing various
              genetic diseases. Further, this will lead to improving treatment options and facilitate use of
              preventative measures via early detection of chronic diseases, such as colon and breast cancer, cardiac
              diseases, and neurological diseases. Personalized medicine in Saudi Arabia will achieve an accurate and
              more compressive approach to its practice. This contributes to realizing the Saudi Vision 2030 in terms of
              localizing and developing technology in sectors with large domestic spending.

              The program also played a prominent role in the field of infectious diseases by studying and identifying
              the genetic factors that cause the variation in symptoms of the emerging coronavirus (Covid-19) among
              Saudis.

              <h3>The role of KACST</h3> in the Saudi Genome Program
              KACST is developing an integrated interactive information ecosystem that contributes to limit the genetic
              diseases in the Saudi population. The program has collaborated with various entities including the
              Ministry of Health, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center in Riyadh and Jeddah, King Fahad
              Specialist Hospital in Dammam, King Fahad Medical City, King Abdullah International Medical Research
              Center at the National Guard Health Affairs, University of Hail, and Taibah University. The Saudi Genome
              Program is one of KACST’s initiatives to transfer and localize health technologies.
